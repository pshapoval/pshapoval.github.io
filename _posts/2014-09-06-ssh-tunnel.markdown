Just found amazing way to create ssh tunnel from remote host port to your localhost.

```
ssh -f user@server -L <local_port>:127.0.0.1:<remote_port> -N
```

-f key to run it in background
-N key to not execute a command on the remote system (without it -f key has no effect and command hangs with error)
